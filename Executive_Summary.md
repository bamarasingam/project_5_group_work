# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
"Most Latin American countries share a history of impunity courtesy of their colonial past[(source)]('../../Research/ASSISTED_FREEDOM_CARCERAL_TRANSMUTATION.pdf')." Since gaining their Independence in the 19th Century these countries remain locked in a struggle towards full democratic rule that is punctuated with cycles of revolutionary action and repressive military rule. 

Notably, United States political and economic interventions have, more often than not, tipped the scales in favor of repressive action. The United States efforts to combat communism during the Cold War fueled the growth of "authoritarianism, massive human rights violations and eventually transitions to low-intesity democracies...(and) unbalanced civil-military relations[(source)](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/latin-america-doesnt-want-a-new-cold-war/)."

•	Democracy vs. Authoritarianism 

o	In statistics, latent variables are variables that can only be inferred indirectly through a mathematical model from tother observable variables that can be directly observed or measured. 

o	Democracy Index:Compiled by UK based Economist group attempts to measure the state of democracy  based on political institutions and freedoms. 

•	9.01-10.00/ 8.01-9.00 Full Democracies

•	7.01–8.00/6.01–7.00 Flawed Democracies

•	5.01–6.00/4.01–5.00 Hybrid Regime 

•	3.01–4.00/2.01–3.00/1.01–2.00 Authoritarian Regime

An important insight of recent research has been the central role of the carceral state (whether the state represses it’s citizenry through authoritarian policing and mass incarceration) in shaping democratic performance [(source)]('../../Research/laboratories-of-democratic-backsliding.pdf'). 

o	This includes looking at incarceration rates, criminal justice policies, carceral outcomes and civil liberties policies. 

	Most notably for the U.S. was the measure of Felon disenfranchisement which had a -0.48 coefficient with regards to the final democracy index. 

•	Coercive state authority, seen in extreme forms in authoritarian policing and mass incarceration, area also mostly administered with state-level authority. 

2022 UN Incarceration Numbers:

•	American Continent 379 average/100,000
•	Steady climb Latin America as a whole 267 average/100,000
•	Steady decrease US 577, average/100,000
•	Share of prisoners unsentenced: 36%  Latin America, 25% North America
•	World average 153 people  


### Data Science & Machine Learning Process

We have chosen to limit our EDA to years starting in 2010, as this reflects the state of the global economy post the 2008 global economic crisis as well as the changes brought upon by the pandemic. 
Also, by not going too far in time, we avoid comparing between time periods which have very different data availability and potentially incomparable terms of civil and human rights. 
Challenges to the project

o	Prisons often remain closed not only to researchers or journalists but also to lawyers and human rights activists.

o	Populations at large delegate to the darkest part of the state the power to discipline and punish with little external control.
